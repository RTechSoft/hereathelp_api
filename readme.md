About Us
--------

We're the [**PUP Programming Guild**](https://github.com/pup-progguild/), a bunch of students from the [Polytechnic University of the Philippines](http://www.pup.edu.ph) who consumes more time outside school, than inside classes. But really, we take our studies to heart. We deal with *competitions*, *hackathons*, and [*action movies*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt_OgYMQFRY).
